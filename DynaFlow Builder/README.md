# DynaFlow Builder
A customtkinter implementation of a flow creator for DynaFlow for Pepper.

## Features
- Read/write JSON and other necessary data directly into Pepper via wireless ADB
- GUI version allows for easy flow creation
- Preview and save JSON before sending to Pepper

## Requirements
- python3 with Tkinter (only for Windows as macOS and Linux variants will have it)
- Android Debug Bridge (refer to [Setup Guide for ADB](guides/ADB.md))

If you do not wish to install ADB on computer, please use the [/backup/adb_frame.py](backup/adb_frame.py) and install `adb-shell` in pip. This method does not have emulator connection functionality, but runs without ADB installation in computer.

Open a terminal console into this folder on computer.
Install the requirements from the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) using
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once installed, you can use `python3 main.py` to start DynaFlow Builder.
