# Final Year Project - Pepper Exploration

## Information
This project includes 4 exploratory Android apps, along with a final implementation app DynaFlow.

## [uitester](uitester)
A QiChatBot enabled app that can navigate based on a preset route.

## [gsmintro_chatbot](gsmintro_chatbot)
A sample QiChatBot Android app that explores usage of Fragments

## [randomutils](randomutils)
An app that explores using additional services like HTTP requests to audio streaming from radio stations etc.

## DynaFlow
The culmination of works combined, [DynaFlow Builder](/DynaFlow%20Builder/) that allows user to create a flow that [DynaFlow](DynaFlow) on Pepper can read and create the flow.

This is useful for scenarios where users can quickly create, modify and deploy flows to Pepper so that customers can interact with Pepper.

For example, during Open House customers can interact with Pepper via DynaFlow to learn more about Robotics.

DynaFlow is capable of connecting to computer wirelessly over the same network via ADB to send flows over without internet via ADB, then run completely offline.
